## A small list of features added by this extension:
- Dark Theme! Finally, your eyes can rest when working at night.
- Customizable user profiles! Now you can show a bit of your personality through your user page: add a custom banner image to your profile, visible to everyone with the extension installed, or add a link to your GitHub-page.
- View how many outstanding flags were given to a user's work on their Intra profiles.
- An option to use the old Black Hole countdown instead of showing one's absorption date.
- Removal of the broadcasts button, which is unused by most campuses.

You can find the full list of features in the [Wiki](https://github.com/FreekBes/improved_intra/wiki/Features).
